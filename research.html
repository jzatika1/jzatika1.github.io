                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>My research focuses on leveraging advanced technologies to enhance cybersecurity measures and financial security. Below are some of my key research areas:</p>

                <h3>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity</h3>
                <p>My work explores the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to develop sophisticated intrusion detection systems. By analyzing large datasets, these systems can identify patterns and anomalies indicative of cyber threats, enhancing the ability to prevent and mitigate attacks.</p>
                <p>Current Project: <em>Intrusion Detection Systems: Insights and Innovations in Anomaly Detection</em> â€“ This project aims to innovate anomaly detection methods within intrusion detection systems, improving their accuracy and efficiency in identifying potential security breaches.</p>

                <h3>Blockchain and Cybersecurity</h3>
                <p>Blockchain technology offers a decentralized approach to security, making it a robust solution for protecting data integrity and confidentiality. My research investigates the use of blockchain in securing sensitive information, particularly in healthcare and financial sectors.</p>

                <h3>Cybersecurity in Cloud Computing</h3>
                <p>With the increasing adoption of cloud services, ensuring their security has become paramount. My research addresses the challenges associated with cloud security, including data breaches, virtualization vulnerabilities, and compliance issues. I develop strategies to secure cloud environments against sophisticated cyber threats.</p>

                <h3>Financial Technology (FinTech) Security</h3>
                <p>Financial technology is revolutionizing the financial services industry, but it also introduces new security challenges. My research focuses on securing FinTech applications, ensuring safe and secure transactions, and protecting against fraud and cyber attacks.</p>
