                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am J. Anthony Zatika, a dedicated researcher and developer at xAI, where I focus on pioneering advancements in artificial intelligence. I hold a computer science degree from Rutgers University and am currently completing my master's degree in cybersecurity at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
                <p>My research is at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity, where I strive to create intelligent systems capable of autonomously defending against and adapting to evolving cyber threats.</p>
                <p>Previously, I founded Globalization Cybersecurity LLC as a passive income generator, where I specialized in implementing advanced cybersecurity measures for various industries. My expertise includes cloud computing security and leveraging AI-driven technologies to enhance the resilience and security of digital systems.</p>
                <p>My research contributions include exploring the security challenges of cloud computing and developing innovative strategies to protect cloud environments from sophisticated attacks. I am passionate about ensuring the security of digital assets in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
                <p>I am actively engaged in the academic community, seeking to publish and share my research findings. My recent work, co-authored with Joel Coffman, titled <em>Innovations in Intrusion Detection Systems</em>, was presented as a poster at the USENIX Security '24 conference in Philadelphia, PA.</p>
                <p>Through my ongoing work, I aim to contribute to the future of AI and cybersecurity, ensuring that the technological advancements we pursue are both innovative and secure.</p>
